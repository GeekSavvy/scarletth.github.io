I'm currently in the thrilling adventure of mastering the art of academia at Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences in Germany. Yes, it’s as intense as it sounds!.

🧑‍💻I'm a passionate and dedicated developer with a solid foundation in software development and a love for solving complex problems through code.


My Journey
======
🚀My journey into programming began with a curiosity for how things work under the hood, Python quickly became my language of choice due to its simplicity, versatility, and the vibrant community that surrounds it.

Professional Interests
======
As a Python developer, I have a particular interest in:

- Web Development: Leveraging frameworks like Django and Flask to build dynamic, user-friendly web applications.

* Data Science and Machine Learning: Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to analyze data and create predictive models. 

+ Automation and Scripting: Writing scripts to automate mundane tasks and improve efficiency in workflows.

- API Development: Creating and consuming RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between different software components.

📙My Philosophy
------

😎I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices to ensure that my projects are not only functional but also scalable and easy to understand. 

Continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and advancements in technology are essential aspects of my professional growth.

🌐Beyond Coding
------
📱When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, sharing my knowledge through posts and community events. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading sci-fi novels, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
